Training regret minimization charts for STP (nu = 3) dEI outperforming GP dEI

The training regret’s inter-quartile range (IQR)  for STP dEI (green shading) is lower than the IQR for GP dEI (yellow shading) for each of the 4 synthethic functions [1] and the real-world problem [2].

Additionally, the root of Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is lower for STP (nu = 3) dEI (versus GP dEI) on the test data’s predictions [2].
